# Verifme
Verifme is a full stack web application built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and deployed to Heroku. It is a platform where Canadian high school students can, in Reddit-like fashion, share posts about homework problems, upvote/downvote other students' posts, and engage in meaningful discussions by writing comments.

Verifme was submitted as part of the 2021 PTC Hacks CodeAgainstCovid hackathon, wherein I collaborated with 3 teammates to ideate, prototype, and develop a software based around collaborative technology. After 48 hours of design and development work, our team took home the 1st Place prize.
